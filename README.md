# SFSegNets
Implementation of Our ECCV oral paper: Semantic Flow for Fast and Accurate Scene Parsing. 

Our methods achieve the best speed and accracy trade-off on multiple scene parsing datasets.  

Note that the original paper link is on [TorchCV](https://github.com/donnyyou/torchcv) where you can train SFnet models. 


## Notice
Now for better and easy usage, I decide opensource another repo incluing SFnet models which are better than orginal paper（including SFnetv2, which achieves better results than orginial ones）. 

**The code and models will be released before ECCV conference.**
