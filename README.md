# SFSegNets
Implementation of Our ECCV oral paper: Semantic Flow for Fast and Accurate Scene Parsing. 

Our methods achieve the best speed and accuracy trade-off on multiple scene parsing datasets.  

Note that the original paper link is on [TorchCV](https://github.com/donnyyou/torchcv) where you can train SFnet models. 
However, that repo is over-complex for further research and exploration.

## Pretrained models and Trained CKPTs
Please download the pretrained model including:
resnet18-101
